## Stater Sites

11tyhas something similar to WordPress themes called starter sites. They can reduce the dev work needed to get going. Some are able to get going with no or limited HTML or CSS skills.

**Here's some places to look:**

- [11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev/starters/). A fabulous place for all the latest by Bob Monsour.
- [JamStack Themes](https://jamstackthemes.dev/#ssg=eleventy).
- [The 11ty site](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/).

There few [exceptions](https://github.com/CloudCannon/campus-spark-bookshop-template), but generally the starter are plain for you to add your own CSS.  Some are created around Tailwind or Bootstrap or include javaSript framework intergration.

Eventy Excellent, like us, uses CUBE CSS (in this case it broken down in to small components). It allows tags and uses Paul Irish's Lite YouTube Embed and has a light and dark switcher.

**These could be useful for the shows website:**

- [The 11ty Base blog ](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

- [Eleventy Excellent ](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

- [Elva](https://github.com/scottsweb/elva).


These all have been updated to 11ty v.3



## 11ty as a static frontend for WordPress.

- 11ty has an importer that can grap WordPress Post (among other things)
- It works best with the 11ty Base blog.

## David's thoughs

With a few exceptions 11ty starter themes are not going to appeal to the DIY builder like WordPress does. The WordPress to 11ty Base blogs might appeal more if there were CSS "skins" to easily swap out styles (ala CSS Zen Garden).
